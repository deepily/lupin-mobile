# TODO

Last updated: 2026-04-17 (Session: WS hookup + envelope fix + Stages 2/3 fixture-backed tests)

## Pending

### Recently-Discovered Bugs (high priority)
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Fix `NotificationRepository.conversation()` + `conversationByDate()` URL encoding — sender IDs containing `/` (e.g. `peer-queue-watch/<uuid>`) break FastAPI path-param routing. Need `Uri.encodeComponent()` on `senderId` + `userEmail` in `notification_repository.dart:194,218,238`. Discovered while capturing fixtures on 2026-04-17.
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Investigate post-login behavior — user verified login works but flagged "may want to debug what happens after that" on 2026-04-17. Check first authenticated home screen, WS reconnect, inbox initial load.

### On-Device Sanity Pass (login confirmed on device 2026-04-17; remaining sanity checks still open)
- [x] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Device sanity: login works end-to-end (envelope fix verified on emulator) — 2026-04-17
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Device sanity: open Inbox (widget-level covered by `inbox_screen_test.dart` × 4 cases)
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Device sanity: respond to an ask_yes_no from Inbox (widget-level covered by `conversation_screen_test.dart` × 3 cases)
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Device sanity: Trust Dashboard renders (widget-level covered by `trust_dashboard_screen_test.dart` × 3 cases)
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Device sanity: DeepResearch dry-run submits (widget-level covered by `deep_research_form_test.dart` × 3 cases)
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Device sanity: run `integration_test/smoke_hello_test.dart` via `flutter test integration_test/` on emulator (proves scaffolding)

### Tier 2 — Notifications + Decision Proxy (polish remaining)
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Date-grouped view in ConversationScreen (uses `conversation-by-date` endpoint — currently using flat `conversation`)
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Sender-dates drilldown screen (per-sender date browse)
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] `generate-gist` UI on ConversationScreen ("Summarize" action)
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] TrustStateScreen drilldown (per-domain trust details)
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Decide whether to remove orphaned `lib/shared/models/notification_item.dart`

### Tier 4 — Agentic (polish + deferred)
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] TimeSavedDashboard + StatsRepository + StatsBloc (deferred from Tier 4)
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Add `fl_chart` dep when stats dashboard is implemented
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Wire audioplayers for in-app audio playback in AudioArtifactPlayer (currently download-and-share only)
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Podcast job: confirm server-side audio path field name for use in AudioArtifactPlayer

### Testing Playbook — Stage 4+ (deferred with revisit triggers)
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Alchemist visual-regression goldens — revisit when inbox tile / DR form / trust chip sees ≥2 regressions in a month
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Patrol 4.x native-dialog support — revisit when app requests runtime permissions (mic, notifications) and smokes can't pass them via taps
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Maestro MCP flows — revisit after `integration_test/` has ≥5 flows and CI parallelization matters
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Fixture coverage for agentic endpoints (DR submit, podcast, etc.) — Stages 2/3 covered auth/notifications/decision-proxy; agentic is the remaining domain
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] CI job that runs `capture-*-fixtures.py` on a schedule + opens a PR when fixtures diff — catches silent backend drift
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Apply TestKeys / `bySemanticsIdentifier` to remaining agentic forms (podcast, presentation, SWE team, BFE, TFE, test suite, research-to-podcast, research-to-presentation)
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Widget tests for remaining agentic forms (DR + prompt sheet + trust dashboard approve/reject covered)

### Cross-cutting
- [ ] [LUPIN-MOBILE] Resolve pre-existing `getIt` import in `home_screen.dart` (orphan from old wiring)

## Completed (Recent)
